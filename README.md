# calc_kids

A simple calculator app for kids built with Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

### Usage

Run the app with `flutter run` and tap the buttons to enter numbers and
operations. Results that are whole numbers appear without a decimal
point, while decimal results use a comma, for example `1 รท 2` shows
`0,5`.
